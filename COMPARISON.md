## Where Deyad Wins

1. **100% free, 100% local** — no subscriptions, no token limits, no cloud dependency. You own everything. Dyad is also local but charges $20–$79/mo for Pro features.
2. **7 deploy targets** — nobody else offers VPS+SSL, desktop export, AND mobile (Capacitor) in one tool. Dyad only ships to GitHub + Vercel.
3. **Full database GUI** — pgAdmin embedded. Dyad uses Supabase (cloud-hosted DB). Bolt/Cursor/Windsurf/v0 have nothing comparable.
4. **True model freedom** — swap between Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, CodeGemma, etc. via Ollama with zero API cost. Dyad requires cloud API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) which cost money per token.
5. **Desktop + mobile export** — unique. No competitor — including Dyad — can produce an AppImage/exe/DMG or Capacitor mobile app.
6. **Privacy** — your code and prompts never leave your machine. Dyad runs locally but still sends prompts to cloud APIs.
7. **Offline-first** — works without internet after initial setup. Dyad requires internet for its API-key-based models.
8. **Full PTY terminal** — multi-tab terminal with full shell access. Dyad has no terminal.
9. **MIT license** — truly open source. Dyad is source-available with a non-competing restriction.

## Where Competitors Win

1. **AI model quality** — Bolt/Lovable/Cursor/Dyad use Claude 3.5/4 and GPT-4o directly. Cloud models produce better code than most local models (unless you run 70B+ on a beefy GPU).
2. **Zero setup** — Bolt/Lovable/v0 work in a browser tab. Deyad needs Electron + Ollama + Docker installed.
3. **Collaboration** — Replit has real-time multiplayer editing. Deyad is single-user.
4. **Ecosystem polish** — Cursor/Windsurf have years of VC funding, large teams, and extension marketplaces. Dyad has 20k GitHub stars and a large community.
5. **Managed hosting** — Replit and Bolt bundle cloud hosting. Deyad deploys to external providers.
6. **MCP extensibility** — Dyad supports MCP servers for tool extensibility. Deyad has a plugin system but not MCP.
7. **Security scanning** — Dyad has built-in security review. Deyad relies on manual review.
8. **Voice input** — Dyad supports speech-to-text prompting. Deyad is keyboard-only.

## Who Should Use Deyad

- Developers who want **full control** over their AI tooling and data
- Teams working on **proprietary or sensitive** projects that can't touch cloud APIs
- Users who don't want to pay **$20+/month** for an AI coding tool
- Anyone who wants to **deploy anywhere** — not just Vercel/Netlify
- Developers who need **database management** built into their workflow
- Users building **desktop or mobile apps**, not just web apps

## Summary

Deyad trades cloud model quality for **sovereignty, privacy, and zero cost**. Every other tool in this space — including Dyad — requires you to send your prompts to someone else's API and pay for the privilege. Deyad doesn't.

Dyad is the most similar competitor, but it depends on cloud API keys, charges for Pro features, and has a restrictive license. Deyad is fully free, fully offline, and truly MIT open source.

For a solo-developer open-source project, Deyad competes credibly on features with VC-backed tools — and wins outright on privacy, price, and deployment flexibility.
